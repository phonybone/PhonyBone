tests for Taggable::File::Image
Sort out class/auto attributes for Relational
- What does Relational really model?  Is it a table or a row (object)?
- When Tag inherits from Relational, or any other object (eg TaggableA::File::Image),
  then Relational needs to define tablename(), etc, as class_attributes.

- Allow for multiple-value tags (or repeated, as you will)
- clean up style
- implement search
- tag utilities (ie post_stuff for file names)
- authentication module
- tag all files in a directory


- create scripts/tag_files.pl
- flush out TagClient/Local && Remote routines
